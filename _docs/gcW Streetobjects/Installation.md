The installation is done via the Steam Workshop. The set can be found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1518967033).

Afterwards, LOTUS should be launched once. Afterwards the objects can be found in the map editor.

> This set does not depend on any other Workshop items.
